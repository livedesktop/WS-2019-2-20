Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5DCH2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Critical Strike Universal","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20661.13510798886873191.5012b7ae-b69d-4fbf-aa56-09f10f95a4a1.37696ac0-832e-4666-8762-f8bed15de0b6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12911.13510798886873191.63f6d2b4-185c-412c-b111-ccc46a0e2a0f.108e8436-c933-4258-930a-5857ab481fc6","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18023.13510798886873191.2608795a-783e-49e4-a4ed-f69a24a12a4a.b4aade73-9371-43c6-9858-43d364033f8f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$5.99⁺","Price":5.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5559MiniCraftInternationa.CriticalStrikeUniversal_gd3g2e18h01tg"],"ContentIds":["e116a71b-eae9-f5be-ab49-0e4fd0e554de","f44a3e3d-ba14-35b8-792b-5d7beefdbb8a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Simplest and Fairest FPS Shooting Game ( 支持中文和英文）\r\n******IMPORTANT : \r\nNew Player will get  a Machine Gun, a Restore Card and a Recruit Gem \r\n*******Sign Up: \r\nIn Sign In Menu, input a name and a password, then press \"Sign Up\" button.\r\n( For security, the password must consist of at least 8 numbers or letters )\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issue for the game, Please contact me at first, thanks a lot.\r\n\r\nPlease connect the game server by WIFI or 3G network, WIFI is better.\r\nIf you can't connect the game server plz check your phone's network condition\r\nDon't try to connect server by 2G network. thanks\r\n\r\nFPS Multi-Player Online Game \r\nPick up your guns \r\nGo to fight with your little buddies \r\n\r\nMany Cute Soldiers are Waiting for you \r\nMany Cool Guns are Waiting for you \r\nMany Smart Players will be fighting with you","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLXMP","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire Pack (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18834.9007199266438312.c9bdfc2d-7f13-40ca-9f66-b6672cb540af.e9a3de9f-194f-4bc2-a978-9bb96103a621","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51385.9007199266438312.be03de5f-a069-4a91-852a-0bcb7829c3f9.9b0ae5ec-a49d-41ab-adb8-76b45f9533bb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SolitairePackFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["976ca466-abff-e391-8051-f18b04a71411","14a6f70a-f32c-ba4b-9428-5dd35bef0a9e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Back in 1990s inclusion of Solitaire (Klondike) and Minesweeper in Windows has resulted in billions of hours of lost productivity over the years. Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N1C1S7RV67K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Highway Traffic Racer 3D - Need for Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18513.13903991993159772.8646f7ab-e825-4614-babb-44c10bc91cbb.00b72051-a711-4476-a219-b7f8fe7ae9dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44410.13903991993159772.2232a574-2252-4547-92f6-7cfe97e07bfa.49d08d4b-8d82-407d-9edd-0d1a5fe7d4e2","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18513.13903991993159772.8646f7ab-e825-4614-babb-44c10bc91cbb.00b72051-a711-4476-a219-b7f8fe7ae9dd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2724RoyaleDragonPacoGames.HighwayTrafficRacer3D-Ne_3jgwmpvqqqyxm"],"ContentIds":["02fba9a2-b172-8864-7c49-1364cb4c5f5e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"#1 Free street racing 3D car game!

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King. \r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NMNJZC26GBN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Slither.io Original","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31451.13754875672492079.18bbce9e-e7b1-4dd9-bb66-d20c6aa58114.3c59fa81-89e3-40ca-bcb2-c4433f4e7fc8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8392.13754875672492079.070fdeca-6177-41f7-9aaa-94ac1734eb71.dfb7531c-b805-4710-a273-ba9f798895a5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31451.13754875672492079.18bbce9e-e7b1-4dd9-bb66-d20c6aa58114.3c59fa81-89e3-40ca-bcb2-c4433f4e7fc8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12926CandyKingStudio.Slither.ioOriginal_803b2e4714cfe"],"ContentIds":["cfbb63d9-821e-d8f3-f17b-a995ef75d749","96e7a578-c92e-7c11-4535-d620c3755fea"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Slither.io Snake io Game an addictive new mobile game that combines the classic game of snake with elements.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

There are plenty of glittering gowns to choose from that will make this ice queen stand out.

This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PC3D9J68GDW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Aeroplane Simulator 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64751.14111251401979772.74c80de5-a17b-425f-87c9-c34184bd71c2.330b786f-4eb2-426b-9d43-c0ad426ad9f1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8362.14111251401979772.74c80de5-a17b-425f-87c9-c34184bd71c2.6b289530-dfd3-458b-ad54-d50daadd9c80","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29516.14111251401979772.4127734b-24eb-4578-99e6-ee494561580e.90eb7872-1300-4ca4-a488-7524ab00e130","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8025.14111251401979772.4127734b-24eb-4578-99e6-ee494561580e.b21fe5c3-4f3d-4b7c-8fcb-b7afb879c545","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["459581FB44CE2.AeroplaneSimulator3D_ae1keq66gdrnj"],"ContentIds":["1ff26dc3-5910-8334-b5d4-29b6262f3ad0","e99604e5-947d-4b8b-db8e-e745df454e67"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Aeroplane Simulator is a 3D flying app that allows you to navigate the skies!

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MX81FFR2CW6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tetris Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22837.13894648430398523.c8d15fc1-70a0-4c15-aeab-56b9056ffa57.b180538c-f386-4a5a-ac50-8f221a202e90","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["22450.TetrisClassic_0aqw1zw0x2snt"],"ContentIds":["1b858cc2-9c4b-8856-2875-4fcd9543cc55","dacfc04c-6c08-3b1b-68eb-762e82fe6b26"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tetris Classic\r\n\r\nTetris is the addictive puzzle game that started it all, embracing our universal desire to create order out of chaos. The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N0T1VPNP1QS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Death Worm Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24728.13919195056523727.8ad80873-72df-4986-ac54-0acd9e8b25a6.27b3a049-4a4b-4b92-9329-d3c0b4883b94","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23635.13919195056523727.8ad80873-72df-4986-ac54-0acd9e8b25a6.e706b1f2-0110-4e9e-877a-04931b2ce4b3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24728.13919195056523727.8ad80873-72df-4986-ac54-0acd9e8b25a6.27b3a049-4a4b-4b92-9329-d3c0b4883b94","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12824RPGFamilyAdventureGa.DeathWormFree_se4vk2zab65f2"],"ContentIds":["25bee031-2c5d-c284-c2f3-51d1f2e86412","ac886afb-4f9f-f6c7-240d-dc233348e193"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Take control of a giant Worm snake and smash through cities and kill enemies!
