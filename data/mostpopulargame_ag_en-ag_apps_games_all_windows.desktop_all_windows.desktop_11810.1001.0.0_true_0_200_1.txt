How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads. Experience speed that cannot be stopped by anything less than a brick wall!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST\r\nFeel the adrenaline overload as you start racing against the biker gangs that rule The City. They are the famous 1%, the outlaw bike racers who thrive on crime and their need for the rush of speed. They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters. Except for power and money, of course.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nCustomize your bike with unique tuning - slap some decals and paint it with your favourite color. Go crazy with the combinations, it’s your ride - your rules. In illegal drag racing competitions being creative about your bike is the only way to become known and respected.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE URBAN SPRAWL\r\nThe City is split into districts, each run by a different bike gang. You’ll have to beat all of the renegade bikers if you hope to assume direct control over The City. Race in a deep selection of realistic game modes and challenges.\r\n\r\nBECOME A LEGEND OF THE ROAD\r\nThe great highway awaits for those brave enough to compete with the best racing competitors in the world of underground bike community. You have to be hardcore to keep up with the criminal kings of the road - but the prize for the best moto racer is really big. Do you think you can become the new bike gang leader of The City?\r\n\r\nEASY RIDER\r\nThis bike racing game is optimized to work smooth on most devices.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided.

But now they’re even more powerful and madder than ever.\r\n\r\nYou’ll have access to older, time-tested turrets, as well as completely new types of weapons. It’s up to you to decide how to spend your available budget. Should you build new towers or upgrade and fortify the ones you already have?

The only way to win is to combine them so that they complement and strengthen one another.\r\n\r\nThe flexible difficulty settings will allow every player to get as much enjoyment out of the game as possible. If you’re an experienced commander, you’ll love the merciless, intense battles where the countdown where even a fraction of a second is vital to success and everything hinges on your ability to choose and arrange your turrets wisely. If you’re a new player, you’ll easily be able to train and prepare yourself for serious battles.\r\n\r\nEither way, the thoughtfully designed maps and wide range of available turrets will provide you with virtually endless tactical options. Thanks to the stunning, detailed landscapes, painstakingly drawn towers, and incredible special effect, you won’t be able to take your eyes off the screen.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the game have been meticulously balanced, including tower statistics, enemy strength, terrain characteristics, and special weapons.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N985JP4S6T7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"8 Ball Billiards 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45015.13537273723463434.c8002b4b-5fd6-4dab-ac94-d8c395e8a775.37154dce-29c3-4c0a-bc7f-21252e374d83","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10037.13537273723463434.c8002b4b-5fd6-4dab-ac94-d8c395e8a775.1539db3c-493d-4326-87c7-faa5df0b6bba","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45015.13537273723463434.c8002b4b-5fd6-4dab-ac94-d8c395e8a775.37154dce-29c3-4c0a-bc7f-21252e374d83","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["15099SimKidsAdventureGame.8BallBilliards3D_zsk4ancj3a1sw"],"ContentIds":["3c86257e-4f28-deff-6974-63a7e9a080f0","255cdec9-17aa-5263-bf60-0582894b36ba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The World's #1 Pool game - Relaxed Game of 8 Ball Billiards 3D \r\n🎱 8 Ball Billiards 3D is the most popular 8 ball billiards game. 🎱\r\nSidespin, masse, jump ball, clearance with one break!

Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are.

Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds.
