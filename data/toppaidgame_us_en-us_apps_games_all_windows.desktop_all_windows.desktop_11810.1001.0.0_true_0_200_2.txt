The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDF56K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FlipPix Jigsaw - Posies","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55365.9007199266282870.567ccfc8-6eb7-42d2-afb7-eaf7550e8e50.14fcc850-10db-44a8-b4b3-c0066c264568","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9284.9007199266282870.1cfc8968-c5e7-4498-9d40-18388da19801.04e60478-8bd6-4ee9-bb80-5f7f82ad09f6","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GabySoft.FlipPixJigsaw-Posies_zx92rj14ktb0g"],"ContentIds":["d45e4fe6-3e12-2fe6-5e45-f7f0fac12423"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Gather up this “pocket full of posies” and challenge yourself and your friends to a FlipPix Jigsaw that is full of nature’s choice colors.

The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter.

To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge.\r\n\r\nMath Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution.\r\n\r\nIn the game the player never loses. There is simply a parameterizable timer, and you can choose the type and complexity of mathematical operations, from sums to equations. The errors of the dynamic panels are counted, but they can be reduced if the flying dragons get wet. Although caution, sometimes this can give opposite results if used too much.\r\n\r\nMath Classroom Challenge is a game for the whole family, which aims to make young people come into contact with mathematics in a fun and entertaining way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MZR1S49QSK1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dreadhalls","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20836.13869754558798936.db3a5175-aadf-41ec-b706-1cc6fe0f7483.7b007262-c9ee-4172-8400-50952165c48a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48860.13869754558798936.8b998ef7-a789-4e3d-aaf3-b57e201b6371.1ffc2244-1337-44a2-8a95-73bb8f41162c","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35419.13869754558798936.d440c78d-ce0f-40ae-88ea-14a3927a1602.75fbe889-60cc-4944-8b2f-e7baac47f333","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22459.13869754558798936.c4eab629-0941-480b-aa49-a3d799a0ebdb.2f550297-ea90-424a-8e42-e603a7679e9f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54942.13869754558798936.071ac408-b214-4be9-87c6-55bf41ee5c47.fba4e502-fcbd-4895-af70-c8f1aed13a88","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":2.4,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["WhiteDoorGames.Dreadhalls_8naj7kgnv8sep"],"ContentIds":["6737f072-a89f-87d7-a7e0-4069d22a7aad"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Experience a new kind of immersive horror in Dreadhalls!\r\n\r\nYou are trapped deep inside a massive dungeon.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

Each type of grape needs to be crafted a certain way to achieve the best results, so you'll have to learn and master each one.\r\n\r\nStart out with a single planting tile, then expand your Estate to up to 33 tiles, using 6 different tile types.\r\n\r\nSome tiles affect the ones around it, so placement is key.\r\n\r\nCustomize your estate with ambient items.\r\n\r\nCHANCE & CIRCUMSTANCE: Terroir's random event and mission system. Players can open the Mystery Box and choose between CHANCE (a random event that could either have a positive or undesirable outcome) or CIRCUMSTANCE (a mission that a Player completes for rewards, or gets penalized for failing).\r\n\r\nJoin Wine Awards for a chance to earn bonuses to your wine's value and your Estate's renown.\r\n\r\nClean, minimalist design and gorgeous low-poly 3D models.\r\n\r\nOriginal soundtrack composed and performed by Singapore's CLARQuinet ensemble.\r\n\r\nPut on your field gloves, grab a pair of pruning shears and build your Chateau literally from the ground up. \r\n\r\nGood luck, and cheers!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N52QV28PDJ2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Blackjack Wiz","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56199.13976044884416461.32ecf7a5-36a1-4982-b199-9505b1f43214.7a35fa5e-163b-440e-9cda-d140fec531b8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50553.13976044884416461.c035e45e-df48-47b8-9766-45fcd8d024d5.dce9c611-a575-42c4-93ff-9688ba60bdb9","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25335.13976044884416461.0d54773b-acab-4b5f-80da-b83039997059.5abee7f5-8d7a-487f-ac96-955877a1b063","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["34600Sea-RocksEntertainme.BlackjackWizCasinoTraine_t71grrsd4xe5p"],"ContentIds":["80839fd9-985a-0ba7-7317-0c691f22c826","433a5f9d-03e3-9f71-6069-ec8d444f7070"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Blackjack is a classic casino game and seemingly so simple.

Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun. Add some good-times to your tables, with Multiplication Dragons!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH10FBN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Golden Christmas - Hidden Object Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32.13510798882272451.edb10545-5eea-4ad7-9dca-4e5eb40086d1.7256f6b9-84b3-4cc2-b07f-73f70a19f522","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59273.13510798882272451.a94bafad-b759-436c-8039-42f8b1aa5cf8.773114ae-1c1c-43a7-bd37-3fc2c60debee","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["BlueArtStudios.GoldenChristmas-HiddenObjectGame_7w153hasn3z84"],"ContentIds":["ca81440c-ca8b-7a19-e1ba-269be57267c2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"People in search of a challenging hidden object game that features spectacular graphics and delivers hour after hour of fun, no longer have to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayHOG presents Golden Christmas, a Hidden Object Game where we have carefully hidden 40 objects per level in a total of 10 levels to give you 400 objects to find. \r\n\r\n\r\nEach level features 10 distinct achievements to unlock (100 in total for the app), and 40 meticulously well-hidden objects to find (400 in total for the app).  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the aforementioned spectacular graphics – which are richly detailed, stunningly realistic and crafted in vibrant colors – our games have been designed with a number of special features that hidden object game addicts will truly appreciate, including:  \r\n\r\n\r\n•   10 Fun Levels\r\n•   40 Objects Per Level\r\n•   400 Hidden Objects to Find\r\n•   100 Achievements to Unlock and Stars to Earn\r\n•   A handy hint feature that even the most experienced gamer will find invaluable from time to time\r\n•   An excellent help screen that lays out the achievements and other level details\r\n•   A level map that remembers progress and high scores\r\n•   The ability to earn stars by completing achievements\r\n•   Great sound effects that can be toggled on/off (perfect for late-night sessions, on a flight, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not bore users with pointless stories that distract them from the goal of unlocking achievements and finding hidden objects and of course, we don’t force users to make in-app purchases in order to keep playing.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Hidden Object Games are difficult, challenging and therefore more suitable for adults, however we are extremely careful about the type of objects and props that we use.

part of the BLUE ANGELS TEAM; try the aerobatic simulator licensed by the U.S. Navy!\r\n\r\nExperience flight at 400 mph just 18 inches from your partner’s wing and face the challenge of official maneuvers aboard F/A-18 fighter jets and a C-130 transport aircraft. An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level. This will give the you best scores and you will reach the top of the leaderboard!\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- F/A-18 fighter jets and C-130 “Fat Albert” transport aircraft\r\n- Innovative formation flying and assisted guidance system \r\n- All official Blue Angels maneuvers, playable in all roles\r\n- All configurations: takeoff, diamond, delta, echelon, line abreast and soloist\r\n\r\n- Use Airshow Mode to complete a real exhibition with a custom sequence of maneuvers\r\n- Additive Mode to create your aerobatic figure\r\n- Special missions: free flight, exploratory, pursuit and C-130 JATO\r\n\r\n- 3D Briefing display for easy understanding of the maneuver\r\n- Innovative help system with three difficulty levels to suit both beginners and more experienced pilots\r\n- Accurate

ball in the park, using Kinect for Xbox One with Windows\r\n\r\n• This application requires the Kinect for Xbox One sensor and a Kinect Adapter for Windows.\r\n• Make sure your system is compatible with the Kinect for Xbox One sensor with the Kinect Configuration Verifier tool, available in the Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 2.0 at https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\r\n\r\nABOUT THE GAME\r\nTake a break and go to the park and play football (or Soccer ball) against a wall and try to hit some extra items that pop up from time to time.\r\nThis is something that many of us did as kids, kicking a ball endlessly or for a few minutes. It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5SP5V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Walking Dead: Michonne","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22828.13510798887339475.897b392c-fd9b-4d4e-8cc2-413fd5efe0b9.dd2ecd2b-b1f1-431b-b1e0-6307941fdf69","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60725.13510798887339475.4f88008a-9bd2-4197-8f99-671e6e7c9e95.8bd569b1-6804-4fc4-a991-2475baec5fbe","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17824.13510798887339475.3241771c-7400-4f23-b191-a64966b28d4b.3f4dd314-6a4c-48c5-bef5-e8407e80ec3e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20506.13510798887339475.e18a24bf-4479-48b2-b9f5-5a3479645781.27f8b9a0-9e9a-4c8f-962e-228c777f4079","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#336699","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21725.13510798887339475.f42ef40b-df42-48e3-a165-acbf058de5b7.01d4075b-bb47-4369-8c48-93a35a360324","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25048.13510798887339475.1640922e-a6f6-44b4-a82f-dc6497b556a6.a3b4d7b4-d957-4586-ad7a-beaeb38e9997","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$4.99⁺","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"35","PackageFamilyNames":["TelltaleGames.TheWalkingDeadMichonne_4p9dzwrngadje"],"ContentIds":["d36a3091-4548-ef7d-27f3-b551892a1aa5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries stars the iconic, blade-wielding character from Robert Kirkman's best-selling comic books.

One such system is the ability to choose between “Power” and “Speed” styles when selecting a character. The “Power” system focuses on high damage while the “Speed” system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique “Hajiki” ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time.

The game is safe for all ages but comes without all the distractions that games for kids usually have. Anyone with a taste for puzzle and mind games should give A Game of Lines and Nodes a try. The game does not require any special permissions in your device, works offline and has no ads.\r\n\r\nThe game involves playing with lines and dots (we call them nodes) but is far from being a simple connect-the-dots game. A Game of Lines and Nodes combines elements of Hashi or Hashiwokakero (橋をかけろ, literally translated to “build bridges!”), plus some features that make it unique, engaging and relaxing.\r\n\r\nThe game is somewhat similar to Hashi in that the nodes have a required number of connections and in that lines cannot jump over nodes or other lines. However, nodes here are 'floating' and can be dragged around freely. Also, there can only be one connection between the same two nodes, unlike Hashi where there can be up to two.\r\n\r\nAs the nodes get connected, polygons and figures takes form, helping you to determine if you are in the right track to solve the puzzle. Just watching nodes react to each other as they are dragged around contributes to the relaxed environment and is quite entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are no timers in this game, or any other element or mechanic that will make you feel rushed or under pressure. You can take as long as you like to complete a level, you can even save the state of a puzzle and complete it in more than one play sessions.\r\n\r\nA Game of Lines and Nodes is designed to be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. You can test your might by playing a level without any help and you may succeed, specially after you are more experienced. However, help is always available if you choose to use it.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads, no subscriptions and no in-app purchases. Also, the game is safe for all ages and  the simple interface and controls will appeal to both young and mature audiences.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文) and the language can be changed at any time from the Welcome screen. \r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n  • Easy to learn and play but challenging\r\n  • Relaxed no-rush environment\r\n  • No ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases\r\n  • No internet connection needed to play\r\n  • Does not require special permissions in your device\r\n  • Safe for all ages\r\n  • Clean and minimalist user interface\r\n  • Option to pause and continue later\r\n  • Original game elements like unbreakable connections, incompatible nodes and more\r\n  • Almost impossible to get stuck in a level with the help system\r\n  • Over 50 challenging levels\r\n  • Background selection and an option to mute sounds\r\n  • Can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese

addictive hidden object game about daily chores!\r\n\r\nFind and spot the given hidden objects!\r\n\r\nBeing a full time mom and a housewife may seem easy for some people. When women go to work, they spend about eight hours there, and after that they have the same responsibilities at home and sometimes a quick lunch or a take away meal could do its job. However, people usually are not that tolerant for the moms that don't go at work. Since they are at home, everything is supposed to be in a biggest order. The house should be perfectly clean, the lunch should be always ready on time, the children should be always satisfied and same goes for the husband. That means a lot of work but when a person says that she was at home all day, it seems that she takes a lot of rest, that she has a lot of time for herself, but how could that person have time for herself when she is always taking care for someone else?!\r\n\r\nThis commitment is usually a pleasure but let's not forget that every mom needs some time for herself, some time to spend with her friends, time to do something just for her, to work on herself...\r\n\r\nDoris for example is a wife and mother of two. She has many everyday responsibilities and she starts each day same. She insists on finishing those responsibilities while her husband and children are out, so she could have some quality time with them when they are at home. That means no time for herself while she is at home but that's why you are here today, to help her finish everything on time, without so much stress.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NLGK7BST074","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Piano Tiles 2018 Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10270.13712449941756009.8ce55e1d-ecd5-4622-8d92-e07d02138ce8.a930670f-8f8c-44e3-bc74-af0b8a6cfbf1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27643.13712449941756009.8ce55e1d-ecd5-4622-8d92-e07d02138ce8.dfa7f3c7-d79b-45e5-a4bc-e77933e187bd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$3.19","Price":3.19,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["21108PianoMusicStudio.PianoTiles2018Pro_m18892jqh4q9e"],"ContentIds":["149ffaa2-b601-42ab-0380-63899193a348"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Have you ever dreamed of becoming a piano black tiles maestro? \r\nHave you ever had a passion for classical music such as Carmen, Fur Elise, Waltz, Canon in D, Moonlight Sonata, The Swan, Turkish March, Songs from the secret garden & wanted to play Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Sebastian Bach, Franz Liszt, Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Mendelssohn or popular classical songs on a grand black tiles piano?\r\n\r\nNow your dream can come true in this winter 2017 with Magic Classical Online Piano Game: Piano Tiles 2018 – Bring Classical Music to Life! \r\n\r\nHow To Play:\r\n\r\nMagic Classical Online Piano Game: Piano Tiles 2018 is very easy to play.

Tanks are modelled with a physics engine and have gears, rev counters and speedos, and steer themselves with brake levers to give them realistic looking tracked vehicle movement. Each bullet, shell or piece of shrapnel is modelled in 3D and ricochets realistically off sloping surfaces. You can see each infantryman's rank, name, weapon, ammunition remaining, heart rate and fatigue levels. Machine gunners will call for ammunition when they're running low and other squad members will rush over with spare ammo if they are carrying any. Wounded men call for medics who will sprint over to administer first aid. Off-board artillery can be called in but will have to fire several ranging shots before the full 8 gun battery opens fire simultaneously.

After your child uses Friendly Maths a few times, the app will start choosing questions that gently challenge your child's ability without discouraging progress. The goal is to achieve that sweet spot where questions are not too easy and not too difficult to achieve maximum benefits.  \r\n \r\nMy motivation for developing Friendly Maths grew out of watching my two children interact with various Maths apps over the years. I noticed that some apps were too harsh on the kids, using negative scoring which resulted in a lot of tears and frustration. Other apps were timed games offering multiple choice answers. My concern with those was that kids learned to quickly press the correct buttons without much understanding of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nFriendly Maths was developed to address some of these concerns. With Friendly Maths, children are not timed in order to allow them time to think, consolidate knowledge, and truly understand problems. Incorrect answers are not penalized and the app often offers second chances. I believe that this approach encourages the spirit of learning and experimentation. Positive reinforcement is used, not negative scoring. This prevents children from forming negative attitudes towards Maths and protects their self-esteem. The apps' simple visual design helps children focus on Maths with minimal distractions, so that learning can easily be transferred into school testing and real life scenarios. \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths provides your child with rewards in the form of collectible achievements. For best effect, parents are encouraged to provide additional positive reinforcement by linking app achievements with additional rewards. You know best what works for your child, whether it is extra pocket money, screen time, taking them on a trip or nothing at all.  Each achievement is unlocked by answering 100 questions correctly, which can be done in a session or two. Ideally, your child should be encouraged to use the app a few times a week, so 3 or 4 achievements a week should be optimal. Again, a balance should be achieved here.  Too little use may not provide optimal benefits, but too much use may result in negative attitudes and fatigue. Again, you know best what is optimal for your child. \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths can be used by up to five children providing they are sharing a computer. It is important that every child is playing under his or her \"login\" as the app tailors questions to your child. If they have dedicated devices, you will need a separate license for each child.  \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths lets you install the app on multiple devices and the progress will follow your child as she changes devices. So, your child can start on one device and continue playing on another.  \r\n \r\nI have done my best to design Friendly Maths for special accessibility requirements, but I have limited resources for testing this. If you find something is not working optimally in terms of accessibility, please email me so that I can improve it. I am really keen to get this right!\r\n \r\nIf you encounter any bugs or problems, just drop me an email. I can usually fix issues quickly. No call centers here, I will personally reply to your emails.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PCFMHRRMP6L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Play Real Drums - Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25865.14170743860097333.42262456-3298-4f5e-a35d-7a7baecbc2b4.30376472-37ca-4f98-b2ea-719aa13d6b1f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31478.14170743860097333.42262456-3298-4f5e-a35d-7a7baecbc2b4.cdd109d1-cfb5-46bd-9af5-c13be1c45295","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13196.14170743860097333.42262456-3298-4f5e-a35d-7a7baecbc2b4.cc3573b8-1fcf-4e64-9ecb-8f02377b151b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MusicBreathLLC.PlayRealDrums-Simulator_4vh60h79arzn6"],"ContentIds":["54ef178c-ca93-57c5-2fa1-923c74ef0358","e50e6b6d-7ec5-e80a-d6dc-679a0ed63a21"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get the hottest drum kits with Play Real Drums - Simulator!

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets. \r\n\r\nIt's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nElevator-Scale VR\r\nFloor Plan: Hands-On Edition adds full support for motion controllers to the original game. Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends. Thanks for checking it out!\r\n\r\nYou can reach the developers on Twitter at

Organizing\r\n 10. Memory\r\n 11. Matching\r\n 12. Attention to detail\r\n\r\nFollowing is the list of games sections:\r\n\r\n-Match the shadow\r\n-Count 123\r\n-Scratch to reveal\r\n-Balloon pop\r\n-Hungry frog\r\n-Tricky maze\r\n-Jigsaw puzzle\r\n-Odd one out\r\n-Bingo fun\r\n-Same to same\r\n-Missing objects\r\n-Hopping frog\r\n-Fill the colors\r\n-Find odd items\r\n-Spot the difference\r\n-Match the numbers\r\n-Sort it out\r\n-Learn to trace\r\n\r\nIn addition to each individual game section, there is a common 'playground' where kid will be presented with a mix of games from all sections. If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed. A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful. But we would love to hear your views/feedback/ratings on the same.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRD1XQD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"WordSearch **","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62709.9007199267159119.be3a7a16-35fc-4017-ab80-8833bac09025.314afc9a-365f-41bf-9e28-5450cbbde760","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FF800D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9828.9007199267159119.e7705680-168b-42f6-9f71-f286e3fc98bb.35149e9b-98fb-4ad1-9c4b-bda023b28d86","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FF800D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"187","PackageFamilyNames":["4937206461CA5.WordSearch_5y43e1txjjtw0"],"ContentIds":["a3f8cb9e-b276-059f-d43b-181d5e05610b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Word Search is an app that will entertain you for hours, offering an endless number of word puzzles.\r\n\r\nWord Search will help you to develop and expand your vocabulary, improve your word power, learn new topics or simply relax recalling your favorite subjects.

Build the Railroad. This activity is a fun way for children to learn the name and the appearance of each letter in the alphabet. Kids will enjoy as each station lights up with the announcement of a letter.\r\n\r\n2. Drive the Train. Kids get to practice making their very own letters, both upper and lower cases, by carefully tracing the letter on a railroad track with their choice of train car.\r\n\r\n3. Garages with Surprises. Children are now tested to see if they can find the right letter. They need to open the correct garage, as their engine drives inside and pulls out a cargo car with a surprise.\r\n\r\n4. Phonics Cargo Train. This activity teaches children to identify correct letter sounds within the context of words. The child’s task is to load the correct cargo boxes into the train.\r\n\r\n5. Engine Search. Children get to think fast on their feet as they match upper and lower case letters before the trains have time to move away. Phonics is reinforced by hearing the letter’s sound after they make the correct match.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG0NQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual City 2: Paradise Resort HD (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.65344.9007199266305273.75d5c65a-dae5-47e0-bb9b-082bb68c4492.a06a3799-c4ed-4113-a9fe-45a0cd79393b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49599.9007199266305273.806be1bb-a441-47bb-92d9-5fef6a1234a1.a5614971-6cdf-45c9-84c5-0ee9140142d1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33019.9007199266305273.f65a032c-b8e3-4021-8c76-49748887be75.87fdef79-f22b-447e-b3c5-7576bb64a916","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10795.9007199266305273.9780598c-c122-4a51-901d-5b181d20f8b8.12a2be40-480e-4d42-8985-d59963ea2e71","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.14065.9007199266305273.4862edcd-d1df-4a8f-ba5d-ee957e4123f1.fb4b5a87-950e-470b-9c09-fc62c4199d45","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.36476.9007199266305273.23e0ea05-a308-404a-92a7-2f78684f4bb2.1001792f-043b-4f54-a564-81ee3a40d5fd","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"77","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.VirtualCity2ParadiseResortFull_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["1e8f2918-a8a9-312c-adb3-61e42e6fc8b3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LONG-AWAITED SEQUEL TO VIRTUAL CITY IS FINALLY HERE! \r\nNew buildings, new product chains, new challenges!

With huge excitement, boys and girls decorate the Christmas tree, make sweets, deck out the house and look forward to their presents. These coloring pages depict your favorite Christmas characters and the main symbols of the festive season. The coloring process gives every kid the feeling of the Christmas holidays drawing near.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

One advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that the child will be able to identify the majority of words in a book before they even attempt to read it. When the child is able to do that they'll be able to concentrate on the meaning and comprehension as they read without having to stop to figure out the actual word.)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRWMV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cribbage Board","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49395.9007199266562255.44cd6f35-4fed-4fc2-9559-4671194b33dc.a6667d0f-396c-477c-8d87-9f95874103a4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#9C0501","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55642.9007199266562255.2258941b-73bf-4b08-84c9-5c0d1b158ac3.a2c55ce0-6da8-4bd0-8cf6-b7f57d320040","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#9C0501","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":2.9,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["BlacktopInteractiveLLC.CribbageBoard_n0svp4frw1h2g"],"ContentIds":["d2eda06e-5b2c-753e-5809-9768a22f4826"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you have any trouble downloading or installing the app, please contact info@blacktopinteractive.com. \r\n\r\nGrab a deck of cards, an opponent and this app to play cribbage anywhere!

Aces are considered low, they can form a set with another aces but only the low end of runs. A Gin Rummy player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all the sets, all runs, or both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal Gin. \r\n\r\nDeveloped specifically for the the Phone and Tablet with an intuitive interface, Gin Rummy will be a pleasure to play and pass time anywhere, anytime.
